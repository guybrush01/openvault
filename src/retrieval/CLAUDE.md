# Retrieval, Scoring, and World Context

For alpha-blend formula, 4-tier BM25, and decay math see `include/DATA_SCHEMA.md` Section 3.
For event dedup thresholds see `src/extraction/CLAUDE.md`.

## IMPLEMENTATION GOTCHAS

### Narrative Distance
- **Resolve `message_fingerprints` via `chatFingerprintMap`** to find current positions, then `chat.length - max(resolvedPosition)`. Falls back to `message_ids` for unmigrated v2 data.

### Context Budgeting
- **Never spread large iterables into Math.max.** Use `for...of` loops with manual tracking — `Math.max(...array)` hits JS argument limits (~65K) with large IDF maps.
- **Score-First Soft Balancing:**
  - *Phase 1:* Reserve `minRepresentation` (20%) per chronological bucket (Old/Mid/Recent). Fill with highest-scoring memories from each.
  - *Phase 2:* Remaining 40% allocated purely by score regardless of bucket.

### ST Vector Retrieval
- **`selectRelevantMemoriesWithST` returns all item types.** Build lookup maps for memories, graph nodes (`graphNodes`), AND communities. Results include `itemType` field for downstream routing.
- **Community retrieval skips local embeddings in ST Vector mode.** `retrieveWorldContext` returns `null` when `embeddingMode === 'st_vector'` — communities already retrieved via scoring layer.

### Query Building
- **Prepend entity anchors before truncation.** In `buildEmbeddingQuery()`, prepend `topEntities` before slicing to `chunkSize`. Entities survive budget cuts; appended text gets chopped.

### Intent Routing
- **Route via multilingual intent.** `detectMacroIntent()` matches "recap", "вкратце", etc.
- **Macro queries:** Inject pre-computed `global_world_state`.
- **Local queries:** Execute vector similarity search against specific community summaries.
